The pain is precipitated by physical exertion such as climbing stairs or walking more than one block and is relieved with rest within 5-10 minutes. Associated symptoms include mild dyspnea and occasional diaphoresis. She denies palpitations, syncope, or orthopnea. Patient reports increasing frequency of episodes over the past week.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertension (diagnosed 10 years ago)
2. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (diagnosed 7 years ago)
3. Dyslipidemia
4. Osteoarthritis of bilateral knees

MEDICATIONS:
1. Lisinopril 20mg daily
2. Metformin 1000mg twice daily
3. Atorvastatin 20mg daily
4. Aspirin 81mg daily
5. Acetaminophen 500mg as needed for pain

ALLERGIES: Penicillin (rash)

FAMILY HISTORY:
Father died of myocardial infarction at age 68
Mother had history of hypertension, died at 78 from stroke
Brother with coronary artery disease, underwent CABG at age 60

SOCIAL HISTORY:
Former smoker (quit 15 years ago), 20 pack-year history
Occasional alcohol use (1-2 glasses of wine per week)
Retired elementary school teacher
Lives with husband who is supportive

All other systems reviewed and negative

Extremities: No edema, normal peripheral pulses
Neurological: Alert and oriented, cranial nerves II-XII intact, motor and sensory examinations normal

Lipid Panel:
  Total Cholesterol: 228 mg/dL (H)   [Reference: <200 mg/dL]
  LDL: 148 mg/dL (H)                [Reference: <100 mg/dL]
  HDL: 42 mg/dL                     [Reference: >40 mg/dL]

HbA1c: 7.2% (H)                     [Reference: <5.7%]

DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:
ECG (04/15/2023): Normal sinus rhythm at 76 bpm. 1mm ST-segment depression in leads V4-V6 during chest pain that normalized with rest. No significant Q waves.

Chest X-ray (04/15/2023): Normal heart size. No evidence of pulmonary edema or infiltrates.

Echocardiogram (04/15/2023):
- Left ventricular ejection fraction of 54%
- Regional wall motion abnormality in the anterolateral segment
- Grade 1 diastolic dysfunction
- Mild aortic stenosis (peak velocity 2.8 m/s)
- No significant valvular regurgitation
- Normal right ventricular size and function

ASSESSMENT:
1. Unstable Angina (I20.0) - Given the progressively worsening anginal symptoms with minimal exertion, transient ST-segment depression on ECG during pain, and mildly elevated troponin
2. Coronary Artery Disease (I25.10) - Likely multi-vessel based on presentation and risk factors
3. Hypertension (I10) - Poorly controlled
4. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (E11.9) - Suboptimal control
5. Dyslipidemia (E78.5) - LDL above target for a patient with established CAD
6. Mild Aortic Stenosis (I35.0) - Asymptomatic

PLAN:
1. Admit to cardiology service for further evaluation and management
2. Start medical therapy:
   - Aspirin 325mg daily (loading dose) then 81mg daily
   - Clopidogrel 300mg (loading dose) then 75mg daily
   - Atorvastatin increase to 80mg daily
   - Metoprolol tartrate 25mg twice daily
   - Nitroglycerin 0.4mg SL PRN for chest pain
   - Continue current medications with adjustment of antihypertensive regimen
   
3. Schedule cardiac catheterization for tomorrow to evaluate coronary anatomy and possible intervention
4. Serial troponin and ECG monitoring
5. Telemetry monitoring during hospitalization
6. Optimize glycemic control during admission
7. Cardiology follow-up in 2 weeks after discharge
8. Cardiac rehabilitation to be arranged post-intervention
9. Patient and family education regarding CAD, medications, and lifestyle modifications

DISCUSSION:
The patient's presentation is consistent with unstable angina in the context of likely significant coronary artery disease. Given her multiple risk factors (age, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, family history), aggressive secondary prevention measures are warranted. The diagnostic and therapeutic plan has been discussed with the patient, who understands and agrees with the recommended approach. She has been informed about the risks, benefits, and alternatives to cardiac catheterization.
