DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:
MRI Brain with and without contrast (03/20/2023):
- Multiple small (2-5 mm) hyperintense foci in the periventricular and subcortical white matter on T2-weighted and FLAIR images, more prominent in the left hemisphere
- Small area (8 mm) of restricted diffusion in the left middle cerebral artery territory consistent with acute/subacute infarct
- No evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect, or midline shift
- Normal ventricles and cisterns
- No abnormal enhancement

MRA Head and Neck (03/20/2023):
- 60% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery at the bifurcation
- Patent circle of Willis
- No evidence of aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation
- Vertebrobasilar system without significant stenosis

Carotid Duplex Ultrasound (03/21/2023):
- Confirms 60-65% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery
- Right carotid system without significant stenosis
- Normal flow velocities in the vertebral arteries bilaterally

EKG (03/22/2023): Normal sinus rhythm. No acute ST-T wave changes.

Echocardiogram (03/22/2023):
- Normal left ventricular size and function, EF 60%
- No intracardiac thrombus
- No significant valvular pathology
- No evidence of patent foramen ovale
- Normal right ventricular function

ASSESSMENT:
1. Acute/subacute left middle cerebral artery territory infarct (I63.519) with transient ischemic attack (G45.9)
2. Left internal carotid artery stenosis of 60-65% (I65.2)
3. Hypertension, uncontrolled (I10)
4. Migraine with aura, worsening (G43.109)
5. Hyperlipidemia (E78.5)

PLAN:
1. Antithrombotic therapy:
   - Start aspirin 325mg daily for 2 weeks, then 81mg daily
   - Add clopidogrel 75mg daily for 21 days (dual antiplatelet therapy), then reassess
   
2. Stroke risk reduction:
   - Increase lisinopril to 20mg daily for better BP control, target <130/80 mmHg
   - Increase rosuvastatin to 20mg daily, target LDL <70 mg/dL
   - Recommend lifestyle modifications including Mediterranean diet, regular exercise when cleared, smoking cessation education
   
3. Neurology follow-up in 2 weeks
   
4. Referral to vascular surgery for evaluation of potential carotid endarterectomy given symptomatic moderate-severe stenosis
   
5. Migraine management:
   - Reduce caffeine intake to maximum 1 cup daily
   - Maintain headache diary
   - Consider prophylactic therapy with propranolol 20mg twice daily if no contraindications
   - Sumatriptan to be used with caution given vascular disease
   
6. Additional workup:
   - Cardiac monitoring with 14-day event monitor to evaluate for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
   - Hemoglobin A1c and fasting glucose to rule out diabetes
   - Sleep study to evaluate for obstructive sleep apnea
   
7. Patient education:
   - Stroke warning signs and symptoms
   - When to seek emergency care
   - Importance of medication adherence
   - FAST (Face, Arms, Speech, Time) mnemonic
   
8. Return to work with modified schedule (reduced hours) for 2 weeks, then reassess

DISCUSSION:
Mr. Williams has suffered a small stroke in the distribution of the left middle cerebral artery, likely embolic from the ipsilateral carotid stenosis. The transient right-sided weakness and speech disturbance represent TIAs from the same vascular territory. His worsening headaches may represent a separate issue (migraine exacerbation) or could potentially be related to cerebrovascular disease. The comprehensive management plan aims to reduce risk of recurrent stroke while addressing his other neurological symptoms. The decision regarding carotid revascularization will depend on vascular surgery consultation, but given his symptomatic status with a moderate-high grade stenosis, intervention is likely indicated. The patient understands the assessment and plan, including the importance of medication compliance and follow-up care.
