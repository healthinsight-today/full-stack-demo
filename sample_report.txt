RADIOLOGY FINDINGS
Chest X-ray (03/12/2023):
Two-view chest radiograph shows mild cardiomegaly with a cardiothoracic ratio of approximately 0.55. Lung fields appear clear without evidence of consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. No acute pulmonary process identified. Minimal degenerative changes noted in the thoracic spine.

ASSESSMENT
1. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (E11.9) - Poorly controlled with HbA1c of 7.8%
2. Hypertension (I10) - Currently under fair control with medication
3. Chronic Kidney Disease, Stage 3 (N18.3) - eGFR 48 mL/min/1.73m²
4. Hyperlipidemia (E78.5) - LDL significantly above target
5. Mild Proteinuria (R80.9) - Possibly related to diabetic nephropathy

PLAN
1. Adjust diabetes management:
   - Increase Metformin to 1000mg twice daily
   - Add Empagliflozin 10mg daily
   - Continue lifestyle modifications

2. Continue current antihypertensive regimen:
   - Lisinopril 20mg daily
   - Monitor blood pressure at home

3. Nephrology referral for CKD management
   - Recommend dietary protein restriction
   - Avoid nephrotoxic medications

4. Adjust lipid management:
   - Increase Atorvastatin to 40mg daily
   - Recheck lipids in 3 months

5. Follow-up appointment in 1 month
   - Bring blood pressure log
   - Consider additional medication adjustments if targets not met

Patient was counseled on the importance of medication adherence, blood glucose monitoring, and dietary modifications. All questions were addressed, and patient verbalized understanding of the treatment plan.
