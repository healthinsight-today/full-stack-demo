mg/dL
0.70-1.30
Interpretation:
This test is done to see how well your kidneys are working.Creatinine is a chemical waste product of creatine. Creatine is a chemical made by the body and is used to supply energy mainly to
muscles.
A higher than normal level may be due to:
Renal diseases and insufficiency with decreased glomerular filtration, urinary tract obstruction, reduced renal blood flow including congestive heart failure, shock, and dehydration; rhabdomyolysis
can cause elevated serum creatinine.
A lower than normal level may be due to:
Small stature, debilitation, decreased muscle mass; some complex cases of severe hepatic disease can cause low serum creatinine levels. In advanced liver disease, low creatinine may result
from decreased hepatic production of creatinine and inadequate dietary protein as well as reduced musle mass.

Glycated hemoglobins (GHb), also called glycohemoglobins, are substances formed when glucose binds to hemoglobin, and occur in amounts proportional to the
concentration of serum glucose. Since red blood cells survive an average of 120 days, the measurement of GHb provides an index of a person's average blood glucose
concentration (glycemia) during the preceding 2-3 months. Normally, only 4% to 6% of hemoglobin is bound to glucose, while elevated glycohemoglobin levels are seen in
diabetes and other hyperglycemic states Mean Plasma Glucose(MPG):This Is Mathematical Calculations Where Glycated Hb Can Be Correlated With Daily Mean Plasma

Uric Acid
(Method: Uricase)
5.5
mg/dL
3.5-7.2
Interpretation:
Uric acid is a chemical created when the body breaks down substances called purines. Purines are normally produced in the body and are also found in some foods and drinks. Foods with
high content of purines include liver, anchovies, mackerel, dried beans and peas, and beer. Most uric acid dissolves in blood and travels to the kidneys. From there, it passes out in urine.
If your body produces too much uric acid or does not remove enough if it, you can get sick. A high level of uric acid in the blood is called hyperuricemia.This test checks to see how much
uric acid you have in your blood.Investigation and monitoring of inflammatory arthritis pain, particularly in big toe (gout)
Useful in the investigation of kidney stones
Aid in diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of renal failure/disease
Monitor patients receiving cytotoxic drugs (high nucleic acid turnover)
Monitor diseases with nucleic acid metabolism and turnover (eg, leukemia, lymphoma, polycythemia)

ng/mL
<20.0-Deficiency
20.0-30.0-Insufficiency
30.0-100.0-Sufficiency
>100.0-Potential Intoxication
Interpretation:
1.Vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium and maintain strong bones throughout your entire life. Your body produces vitamin D when the sun’s UV
rays contact your skin. Other good sources of the vitamin include fish, eggs, and fortified dairy products. It’s also available as a dietary supplement.
2.Vitamin D must go through several processes in your body before your body can use it. The first transformation occurs in the liver. Here, your
body converts vitamin D to a chemical known as 25-hydroxyvitamin D, also called calcidiol.
3.The 25-hydroxy vitamin D test is the best way to monitor vitamin D levels. The amount of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in your blood is a good indication of
how much vitamin D your body has. The test can determine if your vitamin D levels are too high or too low.
4.The test is also known as the 25-OH vitamin D test and the calcidiol 25-hydroxycholecalcifoerol test. It can be an important indicator of
osteoporosis (bone weakness) and rickets (bone malformation).
Those who are at high risk of having low levels of vitamin D include:
1.people who don’t get much exposure to the sun
2.older adults
3.people with obesity.
4.dietary deficiency
Increased Levels: Vitamin D Intoxication

Vitamin- B12 (cyanocobalamin)
(Method: CLIA)
218
pg/mL
211-911
Interpretation:
This test is most often done when other blood tests suggest a condition called megaloblastic anemia. Pernicious anemia is a form of megaloblastic anemia caused by
poor vitamin B12 absorption. This can occur when the stomach makes less of the substance the body needs to properly absorb vitamin B12.
Causes of vitamin B12 deficiency include:Diseases that cause malabsorption
Lack of intrinsic factor, a protein that helps the intestine absorb vitamin B12
Above normal heat production (for example, with hyperthyroidism)
An increased vitamin B12 level is uncommon in:
Liver disease (such as cirrhosis or hepatitis)
Myeloproliferative disorders (for example, polycythemia vera and chronic myelogenous leukemia)

Alanine Aminotransferase(ALT) is an enzyme found in liver and kidneys cells. ALT helps create energy for liver cells. Damaged liver cells release ALT into the bloodstream, which can elevate
ALT levels in the blood.
Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) is an enzyme in the liver and muscles that helps metabolizes amino acids. Similarly to ALT, elevated AST levels may be a sign of liver damage or liver
disease.
Alkaline phosphate (ALP) is an enzyme present in the blood. ALP contributes to numerous vital bodily functions, such as supplying nutrients to the liver, promoting bone growth, and
metabolizing fat in the intestines.
Gamma-glutamyl Transpeptidase (GGTP) is an enzyme that occurs primarily in the liver, but it is also present in the kidneys, pancreas, gallbladder, and spleen. Higher than normal
concentrations of GGTP in the blood may indicate alcohol-related liver damage. Elevated GGTP levels can also increase the risk of developing certain types of cancer.
Bilirubin is a waste product that forms when the liver breaks down red blood cells. Bilirubin exits the body as bile in stool. High levels of bilirubin can cause jaundice - a condition in which the
skin and whites of the eyes turn yellow- and may indicate liver damage.
Albumin is a protein that the liver produces. The liver releases albumin into the bloodstream, where it helps fight infections and transport vitamins, hormones, and enzymes throughout the body.
Liver damage can cause abnormally low albumin levels.

Interpretation:
Serum transferrin (and TIBC) high, serum iron low, saturation low. Usual causes of depleted iron stores include blood loss, inadequate dietary iron. RBCs in moderately severe iron
deficiency are hypochromic and microcytic. Stainable marrow iron is absent. Serum ferritin decrease is the earliest indicator of iron deficiency if inflammation is absent.
Anemia of chronic disease: Serum transferrin (and TIBC) low to normal, serum iron low, saturation low or normal. Transferrin decreases with many inflammatory diseases. With
chronic disease there is a block in movement to and utilization of iron by marrow. This leads to low serum iron and decreased erythropoiesis. Examples include acute and chronic
infections, malignancy and renal failure.
Sideroblastic Anemia: Serum transferrin (and TIBC) normal to low, serum iron normal to high, saturation high.
Hemolytic Anemia: Serum transferrin (and TIBC) normal to low, serum iron high, saturation high.
Hemochromatosis: Serum transferrin (and TIBC) slightly low, serum iron high, saturation very high.
Protein depletion: Serum transferrin (and TIBC) may be low, serum iron normal or low (if patient also is iron deficient). This may occur as a result of malnutrition, liver disease, renal
disease.
Liver disease: Serum transferrin variable; with acute viral hepatitis, high along with serum iron and ferritin. With chronic liver disease (eg, cirrhosis), transferrin may be low. Patients who
have cirrhosis and portacaval shunting have saturated TIBC/transferrin as well as high ferritin.

Interpretation:
Thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped endocrine gland that is normally located in the lower front of the neck. The thyroid’s job is to make thyroid hormones, which are
secreted into the blood and then carried to every tissue in the body. Thyroid hormones help the body use energy, stay warm and keep the brain, heart, muscles, and other
organs working as they should.
Thyroid produces two major hormones: triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). If thyroid gland doesn’t produce enough of these hormones, you may experience
symptoms such as weight gain, lack of energy, and depression. This condition is called hypothyroidism.
Thyroid gland produces too many hormones, you may experience weight loss, high levels of anxiety, tremors, and a sense of being on a high. This is called
hyperthyroidism.
TSH interacts with specific cell receptors on the thyroid cell surface and exerts two main actions. The first action is to stimulate cell reproduction and hypertrophy.
Secondly, TSH stimulates the thyroid gland to synthesize and secrete T3 and T4.
The ability to quantitate circulating levels of TSH is important in evaluating thyroid function. It is especially useful in the differential diagnosis of primary (thyroid) from
secondary (pituitary) and tertiary (hypothalamus) hypothyroidism. In primary hypothyroidism, TSH levels are significantly elevated, while in secondary and tertiary
hypothyroidism, TSH levels are low.
