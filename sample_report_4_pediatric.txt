DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:
Chest X-ray (2 views):
Peribronchial cuffing and increased interstitial markings in bilateral lower lobes. No focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. Heart size normal. Consistent with viral bronchitis with reactive airway component.

Rapid influenza test: Negative
COVID-19 PCR: Negative
RSV antigen: Positive

ASSESSMENT:
1. Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Bronchiolitis with Reactive Airway Component (J21.0, J45.909)
2. Mild Dehydration (E86.0)
3. Asthma with Acute Exacerbation, Mild (J45.901)
4. Atopic Dermatitis, Stable (L20.9)

PLAN:
1. Respiratory management:
   - Albuterol nebulizer treatment 2.5mg/3mL given in office with good response
   - Continue albuterol MDI 2 puffs q4-6h PRN for wheezing/respiratory distress
   - Add budesonide nebulizer solution 0.5mg BID for 5 days
   - Nasal saline drops and bulb suction for nasal congestion
   - Humidifier at bedside during sleep

2. Hydration:
   - Encourage oral fluids - goal minimum 40 oz/day (5 cups)
   - Popsicles, ice chips, and other cold fluids may be more appealing
   - Monitor urine output - should void at least 3-4 times daily

3. Fever management:
   - Acetaminophen 160mg/5mL, 7.5mL (240mg) PO q4-6h PRN for temperature >100.4°F
   - Ibuprofen 100mg/5mL, 5mL (100mg) PO q6-8h PRN for temperature >100.4°F, may alternate with acetaminophen

4. Education:
   - Return precautions: increased work of breathing, respiratory distress, lethargy, inability to maintain hydration
   - Expected course: symptoms typically peak days 3-5, improved by day 7-10, cough may persist for 1-2 weeks
   - School: may return when fever-free for 24 hours without antipyretics and symptoms improving
   - Preventing spread to siblings

5. Follow-up:
   - Call if symptoms worsen, fever persists beyond 5 days, or unable to maintain hydration
   - Return to clinic in 2-3 days if not improving
   - Routine follow-up in 2 weeks to reassess respiratory status
   - Consider pulmonology referral if persistent reactive airway disease

Patient and family verbalized understanding of diagnosis, treatment plan, and return precautions. All questions were answered.
